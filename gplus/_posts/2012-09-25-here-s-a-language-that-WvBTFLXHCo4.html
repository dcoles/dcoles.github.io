<div class="content">Here&#39;s a language that <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/105557068601771362265" oid="105557068601771362265" >Mat Bettinson</a></span> pointed out to me a few years ago. It&#39;s a highly dynamic programming language with some strong Lisp-like features (it&#39;s all executable data) leading very naturally to development of domain specific languages.<br><br>One thing that turned me off about it was the fact that it was a propitiatory language, which worries me a lot for vendor lock-in. While lock-in for other software such as office productivity suites are bad, it&#39;s still possible to migrate the contents to another format quite easily. Programs, on the other hand, are typically an investment of many hundreds or thousands of man-hours and have no simple way to port to a different language.<br><br>If I want to write a serious program I want to be sure that I&#39;ll still be able to run in another five or ten years from now. Thus I find it heartening that the developers of REBOL have chosen to continue development of the language in this direction.</div><hr>

<div class="content">Aww, I loved REBOL. I was drawn into it because the guy behind it was one of the leading lights of the Amiga&#39;s OS development. It was a real ground up redesign of a language with a batteries included feature set for web protocol. There have been various growing pains as they&#39;ve struggled to commercialise it. <br><br>I wondered off for Python in the end but I miss some of the stuff about REBOL, particularly the fact that you just used a single small exe to deliver most everything you need rather than the often nonsensical situation of Python installations.<br><br>The open source move seems to acknowledge that REBOL has stalled in activity. It&#39;s a shame that couldn&#39;t have happened years ago when that was fairly apparent... Not really sure it&#39;s going to make any difference though, sadly.</div></article>
