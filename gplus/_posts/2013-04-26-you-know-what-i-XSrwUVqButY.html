<div class="content">You know what I hate. Games for Windows Live.<br><br>Turns out I had bought the DLC for Batman Arkham City through Steam a while back and didn&#39;t remember until now, so I figured out I&#39;d try and find it. Doesn&#39;t seem to be any way to access the DLC from inside the game, so lets go search on line. OK, apparently the only way to download the DLC that I purchased through Steam is to have a GFWL account (despite the fact that I&#39;ve completed the game, side quests, maxed out the stats and and about 90% of the Riddler trophies).<br><br>Ok, fine. I think I have an old Hotmail account I used for Fallout when it refused to let me sign it... OK. CD key... right lets just copy paste that from Steam&#39;s convenient dialog and... oh look, the GFWL window won&#39;t let you paste in a 25 digit alphanumeric product key... Right. So lets open the Steam overlay and type this in by hand... [At this stage of the process chugged the rest of my peppermint tea, grit my teeth a little and then let out a sigh. I really just want to play this one little bit of DLC...]<br><br>Ok. So now we&#39;re signing in and... &quot;ERROR. Can&#39;t sign in. Please click here to resolve&quot; This opens up a web browser (Internet Explorer naturally...) and a 404 on the Windows/XBox Live page. Fine, I&#39;ll log in myself. Done. OK, TOS change I need to agree to. OK. Now you want my billing details? I don&#39;t want to give you my...<br><br>You know what. Screw this. I just wanted to play some games tonight so I&#39;m just going back and sign in offline and... where&#39;s my... offline profile... and... save game...<br><br>Open &quot;My Documents\WB Games\Batman Arkham City\SaveData&quot;... oh look at that. Empty. Clean as freshly fallen snow on a crisp winter&#39;s morning. Thank you GFWL. Thank you for ruining this evening and one of the best gaming experiences that I&#39;ve had in quite a while...Â <br><br>Also, now that I think of it, that acronym really should be GfWL. Though I think I&#39;ve got a better word choice for &quot;F&quot;...</div></article>

<div class="content">Well, thankfully Windows had kept a backup version since it was stored in my profile, so at least I&#39;m back to square one: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forums.xbox.com/gfw/technical_support/f/253/p/293786/1534680.aspx#1534680" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://forums.xbox.com/gfw/technical_support/f/253/p/293786/1534680.aspx#1534680</a></div></article>

<div class="content">I managed to transfer my offline Arkham City save to a new GFWL account a couple of weeks ago for the same reason. If you&#39;re still having trouble getting it across, I can try to remember how I managed it.</div></article>
