<div class="content">Went along to a day of SIGGRAPH with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/112234557844301087767" oid="112234557844301087767" >Roderick Colenbrander</a></span> on Wednesday. Really worth the trip up to LA, got to see some interesting talks, buy a few discount books and have a nice meal in downtown LA.<br><br>Located clsoe by the convention center, Khronos was running a number of &quot;birds of a feather&quot; sessions and their &quot;20 years of OpenGL&quot; celebrations. Full of lots of interesting talks on WebGL, OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenGL 4.3, but I think the highlight was getting a chance to hear about and talk to some of the Valve developers working on porting L4D2 to Linux.<br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/106462556644344774154" oid="106462556644344774154" >Rich Geldreich</a></span> gave an very interesting talk on exactly how they approached the problem of getting top-notch graphics performance with OpenGL on Linux and some of the tools they used/built to achieve this. One of the most interesting points was that rather than directly targeting OpenGL, Valve has chosen to build a translation layer from DirectX 9 to OpenGL (similar to what you see in Wine or VirtualBox&#39;s 3D support). And if you think about the size of Valve&#39;s code base; a generic translation layer is far more valuable than porting a single game to OpenGL. I didn&#39;t get to ask how they were handling other system services such as input, audio and networking, but given the recent hire of SDL founder, Sam Lantinga, I think there&#39;s a good chance that SDL was (or will be) involved somehow. :)<br><br>I think the other very valuable point to take away from the session was just how useful good visual profiling tools are. Valve has instrumented all the hot-spot in their rendering engine using Telemetry (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.radgametools.com/telemetry.htm" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.radgametools.com/telemetry.htm</a>), so can easily run experiments and dig-down to find exactly where bottlenecks are occurring. Much nicer than digging through tables of numbers or making blind guesses - will certainly be investigating how we can do similar things with our media processing pipelines.<br><br>Sitting down and playing through a small section of Dead Center, you can see all this work pays off - it certainly looks and feels every bit as professional as the Windows release. Exciting times ahead for Linux gamers!</div><hr>
