<div class="content">Here&#39;s yet another unit testing framework, but this one is particularly cool for a number of reasons. First, it&#39;s written entirely in C so supports both C and C++ equally well. Secondly it can do run-time detection of tests through reflection (via DWARF symbols), so no need for macro, static initialization or template tricks. Finally, you can use it do do run-time mocking of functions without having to recompile or relink your application to the mock version.<br><br>All in all, it&#39;s a pretty cool idea to use DWARF debugging information and Valgrind to get some of the dynamic language features, very useful for debugging, out of a very static compiled language like C. Cool stuff!</div><hr>
