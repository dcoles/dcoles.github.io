<div class="content">Turing finally obtains a pardon. It took a royal pardon since the British government was too spineless to do it back in 2011. The argument, at the time, was that Turing was &#39;rightly&#39; convicted of homosexuality laws given that was the law at the time. Obviously those laws were fucking stupid, and as meaningful as a posthumous pardon is anyway, it&#39;s entirely reasonable to issue a pardon based on the fact that society is just a little bit more enlightened than the 1950s.</div><hr>
