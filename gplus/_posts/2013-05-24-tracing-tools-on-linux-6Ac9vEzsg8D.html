<div class="content">Tracing tools on Linux has always been rather poor. While other systems have some really nifty tools (for example, dtrace on Solaris, Mac and FreeBSD). Sure, there&#39;s things like SystemTap, but feel nowhere near as nice and complete as dtrace. Kind of sad since the Linux kernel actually has quite a fair amount of instrumentation in it - it&#39;s just really hard to use.<br><br>ktap looks like an interesting approach using a modified Lua bytecode interpreter to allow writing probe scripts. Hopefully this avoids the problems of the GCC based toolchain used by SystemTap.</div><hr>
