<div class="content">A few weeks old now, but still worth a read to learn about how Python is being used in schools.<br><br>I found the discussion about friendly APIs particularly pertinent. While most of us in the industry wouldn&#39;t blink twice at something like `player.setPos`, using something that fits the user&#39;s existing mental model (e.g. `player.teleport`) can be a huge benefit to less technical users. Of course, this is also the hardest problem in computer science. ;)<br><br>Avoiding boilerplate (for the common case) is also great. The less there is to type, the less there is to go wrong. Everyone loves when things work, straight out of the box, even grisly seasoned professionals.</div><hr>
