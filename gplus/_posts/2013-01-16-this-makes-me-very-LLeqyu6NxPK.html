<div class="content">This makes me very cross. The regulator&#39;s better come done hard on these guys. It annoys the heck out of me when any pharmacy starts selling alternate medicine - basically it legitimises them to people who expect a pharmacy to be full of actual medically proven products.</div><hr>

<div class="content">I definitely believe that some natural remedies have their place - we depend too much on chemicals, sometimes. However, medications that have been rigorously tested and proven are also important. They should be labeled as such.</div></article>

<div class="content">I see nothing wrong with natural remedies myself - I just wish they&#39;d show their effectiveness in a clinical clinical study (more so than a placebo), before claiming they solved everything from nausea to through to malaria. And there are a number we know are quite safe and effective, for example, Salicylic acid from Willow bark is basically where we get Aspirin from, and that cup of tea I just drank is anything but ineffective first thing in the morning. :)<br><br>The thing that gets my goat is either a) products that are nothing more than sugar pills (and have been proven to be no more effective than a placebo) or b) products that make wildly outrageous claims for serious diseases with no evidence at all. Homeopathic medicine does both, which is why I get so cross.</div></article>

<div class="content">I do my very best to avoid chemicals in general, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t be putting any in my body that didn&#39;t pass the rigorous standards of the Queen and Prince Charles.<br><br>I think these pills aren&#39;t homoeopathic enough; with diabetes so widespread, sugar could pose as much as a danger to young children as aspirin, caffeine or chiropractors. I would think the placebo effect could also apply to bottles filled with invisible, intangible pills so the only thing I would allow my imaginary children to ingest would be empty pill bottles.</div></article>
