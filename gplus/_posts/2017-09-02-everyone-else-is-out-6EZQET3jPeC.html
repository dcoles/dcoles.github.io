<div class="content">Everyone else is out of the apartment which finally gave me a chance to debug broken IPv6 connectivity. Every time I enabled IPv6 connections would start hanging for 30 seconds then suddenly come good - what looked like a classic PMTU discovery problem. However, for who knows what reason, it turns out my OpenWRT firewall config was dropping ICMPv6 neighbour-advertisement messages...<br><br>Well. Yes, that would do it.<br><br>Thus I would get about 10 seconds of connectivity while the kernel tried to do neighbour discovery then about 30 seconds of &quot;destination unreachable&quot;. This tends to confuse the hell out of Chrome&#39;s &quot;happy eyes&quot; protocol and drives everyone crazy.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ipv6/posts" >#ipv6</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23neighbour-discovery/posts" >#neighbour-discovery</a></div></article>
