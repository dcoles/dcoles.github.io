<div class="content">So for Labor day I took some time to play through a good chunk of Obduction and actually finished it off last night right before bed. It&#39;s been thoroughly enjoyable and really glad that Cyan has had the chance to produce something new in this genre.<br><br>The game manages to invoke a number of &quot;a-ha!&quot; moments that are essential to any of this style of game (this is why you should absolutely, positively avoid looking up hints/walkthroughs). My only complaint would be the game wrapping up a little too quickly at the end, leaving me puzzling through the plot.<br><br>Difficulty is always a tricky topic when talking about puzzle games - I for one would have appreciated perhaps a hard mode that omitted some of the more glaring hints or sprinkled a few more number puzzles (one point just consists of drawing the same pattern over and over and over again).<br><br>That said, 2016 has been a great year for the puzzle genre. Between The Witness and Obduction, I&#39;ve had the chance to experience some great brain teasers and intriguing stories. Long live the puzzle-adventure genre!</div><hr>

<div class="content">So, I didn&#39;t <b>love</b> The Witness. It was beautiful, but the format of the puzzles got repetitive. It also lacked a driving story, which is what I found so compelling about Myst. The world and lore of the D&#39;ni will forever have a place in my heart.<br><br>Does Obduction deliver?</div></article>

One of the really nice things about Obduction was it had a story behind it. The Witness is like a book full of puzzles while  Obduction feels like a mystery story.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I found it quite as compelling as the lore behind Myst, and I had to go back and read the story hints afterwards to completely comprehend what&#39;s going on. However it does hit a number of the same high notes, so defiantly feel it&#39;s a worthy successor.<br><br>(Personally my all time favourite game is Riven, but that had some really gnarly puzzles)</div></article>
