<div class="content">Wow. Harvey Norman actually went and did it.<br><br>From my quick survey of front-page prices, they seem to be competitive with the US prices at a place like GameStop (for console titles). I&#39;d be curious to see what PC prices would be like in comparison to say, Steam.<br><br>My experience is that UK pricing can be a little bit cheaper than US pricing, but not the huge difference you see between US and Australia. I wonder how they plan to handle any region issues.<br><br>My hope is that maybe this move will show that publishers have been price gouging for a number of years. I struggle to think of any good reason why a title would be up to twice as expensive between markets (even taking exchange rates into account).</div><blockquote cite="https://plus.google.com/+MatBettinson/posts/FH8u9Kea7T1">

<div class="content">Aussie retailer Harvey Norman was particularly vocal about the &#39;threat&#39; of online shops. They argued that GST (Australia&#39;s VAT) should be applicable to all online orders, not doing so put local operators at a disadvantage they claimed.<br><br>Seemingly realising that this horseshit isn&#39;t washing with anyone, Hardly Norman went ahead and launched a &#39;direct import&#39; site, flogging games from a operation based in Ireland. Interestingly they bill these savings as having something to do with the GST, note the &quot;tax-free&quot; below.<br><br><br>&quot;The gaming customer in Australia has been paying too much for years and we look forward to providing our customers with a new cost effective offering,&quot; said Ben McIntosh.<br><br>That&#39;s pretty rich isn&#39;t it. They whined like little bitches about online competition, and now suddenly they&#39;re in on the action and acknowledging that prices have been too much for years.<br><br>The tax thing is a total and utter red herring. Australia&#39;s VAT is 10 per cent. HALF of the tax in the UK. Yet videogames typically cost over twice as much in Australia. It&#39;s interesting that Hardly Normal didn&#39;t call out the publishers. They don&#39;t seem to want to piss them off but... setting up a massive grey import business isn&#39;t going to piss them off?</div><hr>

<div class="content">&quot;That&#39;s pretty rich isn&#39;t it. They whined like little bitches about online competition, and now suddenly they&#39;re in on the action and acknowledging that prices have been too much for years.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t know the nuances of this situation, but I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s hypocrisy. You complain that you&#39;re in an unfair market position, and so you move yourself into a better market position. That&#39;s business. It isn&#39;t <i>idealistic</i> (the idealistic thing would be to try and fix the problem rather than work around it), but it isn&#39;t hypocritical either.</div></article>

<div class="content">The fundamental problem seems to be more publishers setting inflated prices rather than the stores taking a huge margin. Sure, you&#39;ll save a bit buying online, but even brick and mortar stores in the UK and US are significantly (up to 50% cheaper) than our online stores.</div></article>
