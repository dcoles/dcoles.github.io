<div class="content">I&#39;m currently trying to track down an issue I&#39;m having between Android and my wireless access point. A short time (a few seconds to a few minutes) after my phone and tablet enter sleep mode I lose all WiFi connectivity (this is with the &quot;keep WiFi on while sleeping&quot; setting enabled). This causes any streaming audio or active connections to fail (I can&#39;t ping the devices either). The really odd part is that it works fine at work using that wireless APs.<br><br>Reading a few reports like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9781" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9781</a> made me suspect that it might have been related to WiFi power-save polling mode, so I wrote a small app that obtains a WifiLock with WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF set. Success! It fixes the issue provided the app is running (though not great for battery life). Though there&#39;s still something wrong going on here...<br><br>I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has experienced issues like this? I&#39;m currently using a Netgear WNDR3800 Wireless Router running OpenWRT 10.03.1.</div></article>
