<div class="content">Here&#39;s a pretty neat API that was introduced as part of the POSIX.1-2008 spec. What it does is allows you to use the `fopen` family of APIs to interact with strings. The closest thing I can compare it to is Python&#39;s StringIO class.<br><br>The really nice thing about it is it takes away all the hassles of seeking and a whole bunch of &quot;whoops, I just wrote off the end of the buffer&quot; problems. It comes in two forms: `fmemopen` and `open_memstream` (the later dynamically allocating memory as needed).<br><br>Downside is it&#39;s POSIX.1-2008, so not widely implemented on platforms other than those using glibc.<br><br>(Also fun is `fopencookie` which allows you to make your own custom FILE objects - see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Streams-and-Cookies.html" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Streams-and-Cookies.html</a> )Â </div><hr>
