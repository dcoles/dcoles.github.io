The important point of an API is that it specifies <b>what</b> happens but not <b>how</b>. This is important since it allows building abstractions which are fundamental for interoperability. It&#39;s the reason you can take a bit of software written on a computer you&#39;ve never seen with completely different hardware to your own, yet everything runs without a hitch. The operating system&#39;s API hides the irrelevant technical differences and lets you do something like &quot;draw the letters &#39;Hello, Dave&#39; onto the screen&quot; or &quot;play this MP3 using the default speakers&quot;..<br><br>The US federal appeals court ruling is deeply concerning since it claims that in addition to the instructions a programmer writes on <b>how</b> to do something (this has been long protected by copyright) it would also allow copyrighting the <b>what</b> thereby preventing anyone from being able to write a compatible system.¬†</div><hr>
