<div class="content">I’m also pretty happy about the fact that it runs fine on Fedora too.<br><br>In fact, as far as “packaging” goes, the .rpm and .deb files simply consist of small bootstrappers that download/execute Steam in ~/.local/share/Steam (not too dissimilar to the way it works in OS X, where all the meat goes in ~/Library/Application Support/Steam), which makes it remarkably easy to repackage it for another distro.<br><br>Rather than rely on the distro’s package managment for updates, instead they’re using Steam’s own auto-update mechanisms to keep both Steam and the games up-to-date — the same as it works on Windows and OS X.<br><br>Though perhaps this is not the most “pure” approach, I guess it is the one that makes most sense coming at it from a cross-platform standpoint.<br><br>So far the main bugs I’ve run into are crashing when Alt+Tabbing in Counter-Strike: Source, unendurable loading times in Team Fortress 2, and the fact that keystrokes don’t get registered within Steam Community In-game.<br><br>Oh, and the Steam interface is still as clunky and horrible as it is on Windows and OS X, but apparently that’s a feature. :-)</div></article>

<div class="content">+1 for the horrible loading times for Team Fortress 2. It&#39;s certainly not CPU or disk IO bound, so I have no idea why it&#39;s taking so long to start up.<br><br>I think they&#39;ve done a pretty good job at mixing bundled libraries and relying upon system provided ones. For example, if you install something like Bastion, it goes and installs Mono in the background. I also occasionally see it force an apt-get update for certain packages.</div></article>
