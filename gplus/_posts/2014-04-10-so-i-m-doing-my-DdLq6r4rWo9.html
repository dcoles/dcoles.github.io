<div class="content">So, I&#39;m doing my due diligence tonight and changing all the passwords I can get my hands on (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/04/dear-readers-please-change-your-ars-account-passwords-asap/" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/04/dear-readers-please-change-your-ars-account-passwords-asap/</a>). At the same time I&#39;ve finally bit the bullet and decided to use a password manager.<br><br>Up until this point, I&#39;ve used SuperGenPass, which honestly has worked fanatically up until this point, but has the fatal flaw of not being able to generate new password iterations (sure you can add a nonce to the password, but my memory is pretty terrible as it is).<br><br>So currently looking at two options. One is LastPass, which comes highly recommended by some friends, has been around forever and is one of the most proactive services I&#39;ve seen in notifying users if one of the accounts they use may have been compromised. They also have a premium membership for $12/year, which honestly is probably worth it if just that it makes me a customer, not a user. It has a nice browser plugin for Chrome, support for several forms of multi-factor authentication (including Google Authenticator) and can do password generation for you. Downside is that their UI is a bit horrible - the number of times I&#39;ve accidentally generated 6 passwords for a site tonight is pretty damming.<br><br>The other option is using Google Chrome&#39;s password manager. It&#39;s part of the browser (which makes a hell of a lot of sense), these days it integrates nicely with password vaults like GnomeKeyring, it will sync your passwords (though you really want to check that &quot;encrypt my passwords&quot; checkbox), if you use your Google sign-in then of course you can use Google Authenticator and as a nice feature, there&#39;s a password generator you can turn on. Downsides? Mainly that it&#39;s detection of password prompts is not always reliable. And that there&#39;s no way to manually get it to manually propagate a field or add a password by hand.<br><br>Honestly, secret management should be handled by the OS, but given I currently work on three different operating systems each day I can&#39;t really just jump on platform&#39;s solution. Thus password management at the browser level seems like the best bet.<br><br>Well, at least until something like BrowserID kills of passwords entirely. Can&#39;t wait for that day to arrive.</div></article>

<div class="content">Good summary. I too use SuperGenPass (in fact I probably put you up to it) and it&#39;s great except when you have to change passwords.<br><br>I&#39;m scared of a recurring fee for something as important as a password manager. I don&#39;t want to be held ransom. Does LastPass provide you with an encrypted file which you can decrypt without their software in case it goes away or stops working?</div></article>

My main concern is that I switch PCs so often (Home, Work, Laptops, Australia, US, Japan) that keeping them all in sync would be a hassle. Will definitely take a closer look at Password Safe though - I mean it&#39;s by Bruce Schneier. ;)<br><br>The Chomium project also mentions &quot;Browser sign-in + OpenID&quot; as the end solution to passwords, but I can&#39;t find any specifics on their plan beyond <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/password-generation" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/password-generation</a><br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108688191891412975833" oid="108688191891412975833" >Matt Giuca</a></span> And yes, I&#39;m pretty sure this was something that I started using after you did your full review of the system and that blog write up. I think I can thank you for much of my good taste in software.</div></article>

<div class="content">I&#39;ve been using KeePass to store my passwords for several years now.  There are Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android apps to read the database, which I store locally.  I don&#39;t like the idea of relying on someone else to store my password database.<br><br>I haven&#39;t yet moved to KeePass 2 because there&#39;s some features of the UI that I don&#39;t like.</div></article>

<div class="content">Do you/we really need to go and change every password to every site?  Not all sites/services have been affected.  But maybe it&#39;s too much to assume that all who have been will tell us?</div></article>
