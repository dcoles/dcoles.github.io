<div class="content">It&#39;s amazing, over here in the good ol&#39; gas-guzzling USA we actually have meaningful action taking place in California.  The Tesla Model S has achieved the &quot;status symbol&quot; spot amongst cars (and believe me, those things go pretty well ;) ), It&#39;s cheaper to source power from solar and there seems to be a resurgence of interest in high speed rail etc.  This really puts Australia to shame.<br><br>Honestly, I think the future is bright for renewable energy simply because of the economics of PV production.  A recent UBS report finds it will most likely be cheaper for most households to go off grid in 2018, carbon tax or no carbon tax.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/ubs-australian-households-go-grid-2018" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/ubs-australian-households-go-grid-2018</a><br><br>The Australian government seems blind to this fact and seems to wants to destroy investment in this sector.  I&#39;m not sure what the motivation is behind this, whether its an entrenched &quot;colony mindset&quot; in Conservatives (colonies typically focus on extractive and low-value primary industries), economic illiteracy/incompetency, or a much more sinister alternative (political corruption/lobbying from the coal industry).<br><br>The good thing is, you can still stick it to the proverbial man by divesting from fossil fuel shares (See <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gofossilfree.org/" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://gofossilfree.org/</a> etc) as well as investing in rooftop PV.  I&#39;ve already done the divestment side of things, working on the PV investment.</div></article>

<div class="content">It is interesting, they have revealed the carbon tax removing some billions of dollars from their income, but they have not told big business that they have to reduce their prices or give back the incentives that they are getting since the introduction gave them special bonuses.<br><br>So now the government that is transfixed on paying off our deficit ASAP, reducing age care, school funding, pensions . . . . Carefully look after big business and sucking money out of the poor people.<br>Mind you we do have it pretty good over here.<br><br>As for saving $550 no way, this is costing the country a fortune.</div></article>

<div class="content">I think that&#39;s the most depressing part. I&#39;ll admit that the carbon tax may not have been perfect, but it had it&#39;s incentives in the right place. You pay to pollute, the government uses the income to encourage new industries as well as compensating those who may have been worse off (everyone got a tax break and some extra assistance to those on the pension and welfare).<br><br>And it seemed to be working, having curbed carbon dioxide from the energy sector by up to 17 million tonnes ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com.au/story/2423463/carbon-price-helped-curb-emissions-anu-study-finds/?cs=8" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.theguardian.com.au/story/2423463/carbon-price-helped-curb-emissions-anu-study-finds/?cs=8</a> ). I&#39;m far from convinced &quot;direct action&quot; will have near as much an impact, especially when the incentive is &quot;we&#39;ll pay you if you don&#39;t pollute (as much)&quot;.<br><br>But hey, congratulations Mr. Abbott: you kept your &quot;blood oath&quot;.</div></article>
