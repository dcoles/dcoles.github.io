<div class="content">Well, first of all, this is not a &quot;three strikes and you&#39;re out&quot; policy as seen in other countries like France and New Zealand. That kind of response seems wildly disproportionate to the crime, especially when it only required three accusations from a rights holder. &quot;Three strikes and we can take legal measures through the courts&quot; seems far more balanced approach, though I wonder how it will play out in practice (hopefully not a mass case of &quot;settle or we&#39;ll sue&quot;). I also wonder if this has any attachment to the recent US-backed IP regulations (I remember something about a &quot;traffic court&quot;-like provision).</div><blockquote cite="https://plus.google.com/+JeremyVisser/posts/f7jvpvYoxEJ">

<div class="content">Trying to comprehend this anti-piracy thing — in particular, whether it is evil or not.<br><br>To me, it looks like “three strikes and you’re out”, except without the “and you’re out” bit. If so, that makes much more sense than cutting the connection off without the matter even going to court.<br><br>I’m surprised to see Internode part of it.</div><hr>
