<div class="content">I can highly recommend Batman Arkham Bundle that was on special last weekend. Arkham Asylum, while not overly difficult, has a lot of fun gameplay that really makes you feel like Gotham&#39;s caped crusader. Great fun to swing from gargoyle to gargoyle and then swoop down to take out a thug before vanishing into the rafters again. And from my early impressions Arkham City looks to only improve on this experience.<br><br>Controls on PC are generally pretty good, though the occasional fixed camera angle scenes are frustrating (especially you&#39;re trying to dodge a crowd of thugs or make a precision jump).<br><br>And the one big downside: Holy crazy DRM Batman! Arkham Asylum on Steam had not just one or two levels of DRM, but three levels stacked on top of one another. You get Steam + SecureRom + GFWL. Wow. Talk about over the top. Thankfully I found out you can create a &quot;local&quot; account in GFWL which meant it kept mostly out of the way and meant I didn&#39;t just give up on the game like I did with Bioshock 2. I&#39;m told the game also has wonderful features like requiring an &quot;always on&quot; internet connection and online pass for certain &quot;additional&quot; game content. I can see why people just decide to forgo PC gaming for a console or prefer to used cracked copies even if they&#39;ve legitimately purchased the game.</div><hr>

<div class="content">Yeah. That was a nice feature of Arkham City. Arkham Asylum required you at least create a local account or it would refuse to save your game. I wish I knew I could do that in Bioshock 2 - might have enjoyed that game if I could play it.</div></article>
