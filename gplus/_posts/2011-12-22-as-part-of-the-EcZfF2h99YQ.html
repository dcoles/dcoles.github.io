<div class="content">As part of the great Christmas holiday tradition of fixing the family&#39;s computers, I&#39;ve been looking at a weird issue with the younger brother&#39;s PC. Occasionally it will crash in such a way that it&#39;s NIC floods the network with junk data in such a way that the entire local Ethernet fails (even pinging other hosts showed over 80% packet loss).<br><br>Unfortunately I&#39;ve not been able to capture exactly what it&#39;s sending - directly attaching my laptop shows a huge number of bytes being received, but they don&#39;t propagate up the stack far enough to be captured with Wireshark. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s just spewing noise, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be affecting the rx_err count (though it does hive a large number of rx_mac_pause/rx_64_byte_packets).<br><br>Current solution seems to be reset the PC and everything is good, though I&#39;d be curious to see exactly what it was sending that could trash all network connectivity. Maybe time to go Google the network card details...</div></article>

<div class="content">It would be a good idea if it were more reproducible. So far it&#39;s only happened once in the two weeks I&#39;ve been back home. I was meaning to go digging through the crash logs to see if it gives any clues why the system hung - would be great if it was crashing 3 times a day like family said it was.</div></article>
