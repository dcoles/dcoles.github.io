<div class="content">I think EBCDIC was actually worse since it was only a standard if you were using IBM Mainframes. And even then it had code pages that were incompatible with one another (reminds me a little of the whole ISO-8859 mess...). I love Unicode and UTF-8 exist, and that these days character encoding is more or less a solved problem. :)</div></article>

<div class="content">Well EBCDIC did have it&#39;s fair share of issues, but it was designed to solve different problems and with a different mindset to ASCII.<br>And while it too had it&#39;s own issues, it in many cases copped too much flack IMO because it is mainframe related, not due to poor execution to meet design goals set.<br>That said, Unicode is very much the closest thing to an encoding solution at the moment.</div></article>
