<div class="content">Great article on this, and the suggestions at the end overall are good ones.<br><br>At one of my recent jobs, I had counted the ways in which someone might communicate to me a task that needed to be done. It ended up being 9.  Because the company didn&#39;t put any effort into addressing the communications gap as they grew, teams started to naturally silo and picked their own communications methods.<br><br>Very few other people had to deal with all 9 methods, usually teams only had 2-3 ways in and out.<br><br>Definitely recommend focusing on on-boarding as well. I tend to time how quickly a dev can go from starting the job to compiling the project locally. One place I worked, this ended up taking two months due to all the business silos, access hurdles, and tribal knowledge. If this is ever beyond a week or two, it&#39;s probably a sign on-boarding needs a lot of work.</div></article>
