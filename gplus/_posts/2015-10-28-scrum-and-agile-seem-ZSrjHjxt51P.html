Since posting the article I&#39;ve had a few other people issue similar words of caution.<br><br>What I do like about this article is that it does highlight several valid criticisms of agile - that it&#39;s very mechanical and focused on short-term goals, but agile also has it&#39;s merits (a focus on rapid iteration rather than BDUF, good code hygiene and refactoring and collaborative coding).<br><br>What I really would like to see in an article is a comparison to other development methodologies which covers where and when they&#39;re appropriate. I suspect that if you talk to the original proponents of agile, they&#39;ll suggest it&#39;s a little more subtle than a one-size-fits-all process for all teams and projects. Much like selecting a development tool, you want to some thought put into whether this the right process for <b>your</b> situation.</div></article>

<div class="content">Well, &quot;Agile&quot; is a philosophical alignment toward iterative development rather than preplanned schedules, not a specific methodology. Saying &quot;is Agile right for us?&quot; is like saying &quot;is Programming Language right for us?&quot;... someone will have to say &quot;uh, which one?&quot;.<br><br>Also, there aren&#39;t many named software development methodologies that don&#39;t come somewhere under the &quot;agile&quot; umbrella. (Good luck finding an active proponent of &quot;Waterfall&quot;.) I guess there&#39;s these: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Plan-driven_software_development#Overview_of_Plan-driven_methodologies" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Plan-driven_software_development#Overview_of_Plan-driven_methodologies</a> ...</div></article>

<div class="content">Well, at least they&#39;re trying. It could be worse: one of our teams is on a 3 month development cycle and is still building up mountains of technical debt. And they still call it &quot;agile&quot;.</div></article>
