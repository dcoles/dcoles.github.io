title: Welcome to Jekyll!

So nearly nine years after [floating the idea of hosting a static blog](/blog/2010/03/27/blog-launch.html),
 a brief foray into self-hosted PHP blogging with [Serendipity](https://docs.s9y.org/) and hosting a blog on
[Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/); I've finally come back to the concept with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

So why Jekyll? In large parts, due to it being well integrated into [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com),
having no dependency on a database or interpreted runtime for serving and having an excellent
[importer](https://import.jekyllrb.com/) that I could use to import all my old posts from Blogger.

Blogger ticked most of the boxes for low-maintenance blog-hosting, but I always found myself fighting with it
whenever I needed to write a post with some sort of code snippet. Secondly Blogger hasn't had too much love from
Google over the last 5 years, so the site's theming and layout is starting to look a bit long in the tooth.

Thanks to the [`jekyll-redirect-from`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) plugin, all the
posts should now have redirects from their Serendipity and Blogger-based URLs, so hopefully no links are broken
either.

Next up... I wonder if I can [import my public Google+ posts...](https://plus.google.com/+DavidColes/posts/N2xEa9CzhrH)
