# `tel:` scheme redirect

## What's this?

This is a simple client-side (JavaScript) redirect to `tel:` URLs.

Upon opening the page your browser or phone will ask you what you want to do with the number.

**For example:** <https://dcoles.net/tel/#+1-760-706-7425> (`tel:+1-760-706-7425`)

## Why?

Many websites and applications don't allow using a `tel:` URL directly
(e.g. [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)), so this is a simple workaround.

## What's that example phone number?

[+1 760 706-7425](https://dcoles.net/tel/#+1-760-706-7425) is the US number of
