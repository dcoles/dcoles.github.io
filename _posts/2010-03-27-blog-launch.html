So, I’ve finally bit the bullet and installed a Blog.<br /><br />My original plan had been to write my own Python based static blog (most likely based on <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">Docutils</a> and reStructured Text), but that began to quickly turned into a rather more complex process than I had planned. I got as far as writing out a dummy ATOM feed and then classes started again…<br /><br />I’d really like to come back to that at some point, but at least now when I think “Wow! This would make an interesting post” I’ll have somewhere to put it.
