First, let me say,&nbsp;<span class="caps">SSH</span>&nbsp;with public keys is awesome. Especially with a ssh-agent. You type in a passphase for your key the first time you want to use it and then it persists throughout a session. No more typing in your password 20 times every time you wish to do a `svn up` on a svn+ssh repository. And even better, your passphase is never sent over the network. I love public keys, and use them all the time.<br />Unfortunately it seems I might love them a bit too much. When trying to log into some boxes recently, I’ve started to get the following error:<br /><div class="text geshi"><br />dcoles@krikkit:~$ ssh damogran.local<br />Received disconnect from 192.168.1.10: 2: Too many authentication failures for dcoles<br />&nbsp;</div>Turns out the problem is that sshd has a limit on the number of authentication attempts that can be made (see&nbsp;<strong>MaxAuthTries</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>sshd_config(5)</strong>&nbsp;) and each public key attempted counts as an attempt. Since I can’t really change this setting on every remote host I have access to I’ve had to get a bit smarter with keys.<br />The solution was to edit&nbsp;<code>~/.ssh/config</code>&nbsp;to only sent public keys when required:<br /><div class="text geshi"><br /># Server 1<br />Host server.example.com<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; User dcoles<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PubkeyAuthentication yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa # Public key for this server<br /><br /># Don’t send PublicKeys to other hosts – I have too many<br />Host *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PubkeyAuthentication no<br />&nbsp;</div>The&nbsp;<strong>IdentityFile</strong>&nbsp;clause is pretty powerful. You can use the escape characters in the filename to choose a public key file based on host or username of the server (see&nbsp;<strong>ssh_config(5)</strong>&nbsp;).
