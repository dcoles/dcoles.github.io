You've stumbled upon my website. As you can see, there's not too much here at present.

I'm currently a staff software engineer at [Sony Interactive Entertainment](https://www.sie.com/en/)'s *Cloud Gaming
Engineering and Infrastructure* team. [We're also hiring](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/corporate/about/careers/).
